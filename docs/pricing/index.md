## Cost Comparison: Third Space vs DIY AWS

### Scenario: Pro Tier Usage (5 hours/month)

**Third Space Pro:**
- Monthly cost: **$49**
- Includes: GPU, infrastructure, support, updates
- Setup time: 5 minutes
- Maintenance: Zero

**AWS DIY (Equivalent):**
- G6.xlarge instance: $0.75/hr × 5 hrs = $3.75
- Data transfer: ~$5/month
- Load balancer: $5/month (prorated)
- Storage: $2/month
- **Recurring monthly: ~$16**

**Plus one-time costs:**
- Your time setting up: 40 hours ($2,000-4,000 value)
- Ongoing maintenance: 5 hrs/month ($250-500/month value)
- DevOps expertise required

**Break-even:**
Third Space makes sense if:
- You value your time at more than $0 (setup/maintenance)
- You stream under 100 hours/month consistently
- You want zero operational overhead

**When DIY makes sense:**
- You stream 150+ hours/month 24/7
- You have existing AWS infrastructure
- You have in-house DevOps team
- You need extreme customization
