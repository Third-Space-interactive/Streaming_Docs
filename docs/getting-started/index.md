# Getting Started

## Built by Game Developers for Game Developers

Welcome to Third Space Streaming Platform! We've built a solution that eliminates the complexity of deploying Unreal Engine Pixel Streaming applications to the cloud.

## Why Choose Third Space?

### The Traditional AWS Approach

Setting up Pixel Streaming on AWS traditionally requires:

- **Weeks of setup time** - Configuring VPCs, security groups, load balancers
- **Deep AWS expertise** - Understanding EC2, Auto Scaling, CloudFormation
- **Manual GPU configuration** - Installing NVIDIA drivers, configuring CUDA
- **Complex networking** - Setting up TURN/STUN servers, WebRTC infrastructure
- **Ongoing maintenance** - Monitoring, updates, security patches
- **Unpredictable costs** - Complex pricing across multiple AWS services

### The Third Space Approach

With Third Space, you can:

- **Deploy in 5 minutes** - Upload your packaged project and go live
- **No infrastructure knowledge needed** - We handle all the AWS complexity
- **One-click deployment** - Automatic OS detection and GPU provisioning
- **Built-in scaling** - From single demos to 30+ concurrent classroom sessions
- **Zero maintenance** - We handle updates, monitoring, and optimization
- **Transparent pricing** - Simple credit-based system (1 credit = 1 minute Linux)

## How It Works
